Privacy Policy for NoTap: Accidental Touch Lock

Last Updated: December 8, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the mobile application NoTap: Accidental Touch Lock ("NoTap") collects, uses, and protects your information.

NoTap is designed as a utility focused on user privacy. We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, email addresses, or precise location data.

1. Information Collection and Use (Non-Personal Data)

NoTap collects and uses non-personal information through integrated Third-Party Software Development Kits (SDKs) and internal mechanisms:

a) Billing and Monetization Data (Google Play Billing & AdMob)

Integrated Services: Google Play Billing (for In-App Purchases - IAP) and AdMob (for advertising).

Data Collected: Android Advertising ID, IP Address (for geographic ad targeting), and purchase status data (to track Premium access).

Purpose: To provide and manage the lifetime_premium access and to display personalized or non-personalized advertisements in the free version of the application.

b) Internal Usage Data

Data Collected: An internal counter to track the number of successful screen unlocks (GlobalState.unlockCount).

Purpose: To improve user experience, optimize app flow, and determine the optimal moment for in-app review prompts. This data is stored locally on your device only.

2. Critical Permissions and Sensitive Data Usage

NoTap requires the following critical permissions exclusively to execute its core function of screen and button blocking:

a) Accessibility Service Permission (BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE)

Usage: This permission is the core functionality of the app. It is used strictly to intercept and block critical hardware events, specifically the Volume Buttons and the Back Key, while the screen overlay is active.

Guarantee: NoTap does not use this permission to read, collect, store, transmit, or monitor personal data, screen content, passwords, or user input data of any kind. This permission is dedicated solely to event interception for the lock function.

b) Display Over Other Apps Permission (SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW)

Usage: This permission is required to draw the Screen Overlay (the transparent lock layer or the Ghost Mode black screen) over other running applications, preventing accidental touches on the screen.

Guarantee: This permission is used exclusively for drawing the touch-blocking interface.

3. Data Security and Retention

NoTap does not transmit any user-generated personal data. Any non-personal data collected by third-party SDKs (AdMob, Billing) is handled by those providers and subject to their respective policies. Internal usage data (e.g., unlockCount) is automatically deleted upon uninstallation of the application.

4. Consent and User Rights (GDPR/LGPD)

By downloading and using NoTap, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Due to our global user base, we adhere to high standards of privacy, including:

GDPR (Europe): Users have the right to access, rectify, or erase their usage data. Since we do not store PII, user rights pertain primarily to data held by third-party ad networks (AdMob).

LGPD (Brazil): Users maintain the right to confirmation, access, correction, and elimination of personal data.
